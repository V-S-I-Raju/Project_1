(1) Study Hours
ML Effect:
- Strong positive effect
- More study → higher predicted score

Why?
- In My Training data, students with more study hours scored more
- ML learns:
Study ↑ → Score ↑

App Logic:
- No penalty or limit
- Only advice if too low
Final Impact:
- Always increases score
- One of the most important features

Example:
2 hrs → low score
6 hrs → medium-high score
9 hrs → high score

(2) Attendance (%)
ML Effect:
- Strong positive effect
- Higher attendance improves prediction
Why?
- Data shows attendance and score move together

ML learns:
Attendance ↑ → Score ↑

App Logic:
- Advice if attendance < 75%
- No direct penalty
Final Impact:
✔ Directly pushes score upward
✔ Shows consistency and discipline

Example:
- 60% → score drops
- 85% → score improves clearly

(3) Sleep Hours (MOST INTERESTING FEATURE):
ML Effect: 
- Positive effect
- ML thinks “more sleep = better”

Why?
Training data mostly had:
- 7–8 hrs = good scores
- No bad oversleep examples

App Logic: 
Sleep Hours	Effect
< 6 hrs	      Advice only (bad habit)
7–8 hrs	      Ideal (best performance)
> 9 hrs	      Penalty applied
if sleep_hours > 9:
    predicted_score -= 5

Final Impact:
- Healthy sleep helps
- Too much sleep reduces score

This creates a realistic, non-linear effect.

(4) Mobile Usage: 
ML Effect:
- Negative effect
- More mobile usage → lower score

Why?
- Data consistently shows distraction reduces performance
ML learns:
- Mobile ↑ → Score ↓

App Logic: 
- Advice if mobile > 4 hrs
- No extra penalty needed
Final Impact:
- High usage reduces score
- Low usage helps indirectly
